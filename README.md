### Basic Python SQLite3 Demo

- Creates an in-memory sqlite db
- Creates db tables
- Inserts data into tables
- Runs aggregation queries

No dependencies required to install as slqite3 and logging are part of the standard library.

You can optionally run `python -m venv venv` to create a virtual environment to install additional dependencies. 

Example: `source venv/bin/activate` and `pip install ipython ipdb` for debugging.
